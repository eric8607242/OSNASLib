# OneShot_NAS_example
## Introduction
The is a example repo for one-shot NAS. We cover the basic implementation for one-shot NAS(e.g., supernet, search strategy, and training strategy).

**The main components of one-shot NAS in this repo**
* Supernet
    * Search space of ProxylessNAS
    * Search space of FbNet
* Supernet training strategy
    * Uniform sampling
    * Strict fairness
* Search Strategy
    * Gradient Descent(Differentiable)
    * Random search
    * Evolution algorithm

## Ongoing
* Supernet architecture for each search space
